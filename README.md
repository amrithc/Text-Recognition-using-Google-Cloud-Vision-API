# Text-Recognition-using-Google-Cloud-Vision-API
Vision API can be used for text recognition, face detection, object detection, etc. Weâ€™ll be using the ImageAnnotator Client to extract Text from Images with Python Programming Language.

You could only extract text from images, so for single image extraction. Use Vision_API.py file.

For multiple images use Vision_API(For Multiple Images).py

For further step by step procedure,follow the documentation.
